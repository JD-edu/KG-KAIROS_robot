'''
1. importing necessary modules
'''
import cv2
import time 
import os 
from jd_opencv_lane_detect import JdOpencvLaneDetect

'''
2. Creating object from classes
  1) OpenCV lane detecting object from JdOpencvLaneDetect class 
'''

# OpenCV line detector object
cv_detector = JdOpencvLaneDetect()

'''
3. Creating camera object and setting resolution of camera image
cv2.VideoCapture() function create camera object.  
'''
# Camera object: reading image from camera 
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)
# Setting camera resolution as 320x240
cap.set(3, 320)
cap.set(4, 240)

'''
4. Perform real driving
In this part, we perform real OpenCV lane detecting driving.
When you press 'q' key, it stp deepThinkCar.
While on driving, driving is recorded. 
'''
# real driving routine 
while True:
    time.sleep(0.1)
    ret, img_org = cap.read()
    if ret:
        # Find lane angle
        lanes, img_lane = cv_detector.get_lane(img_org)
        angle, img_angle = cv_detector.get_steering_angle(img_lane, lanes)
        if img_angle is None:
            print("can't find lane...")
            pass
        else:
            cv2.imshow('lane', img_angle)
            print(angle)
        
        if cv2.waitKey(1) & 0xFF == ord('q'):
            break
    else:
        print("cap error")
'''
5. Finishing the driving
Releasing occupied resources
'''
cap.release()
cv2.destroyAllWindows()
